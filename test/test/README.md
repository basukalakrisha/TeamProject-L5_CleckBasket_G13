# Payment System Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

1. **Redirection Issue**: After PayPal payment, users were being redirected to cart.php instead of success.php
2. **Payment Status Update Issue**: Payment status remained "Pending" instead of changing to "Booked" after payment

## Technical Details

### Redirection Fix
- Modified success.php to be more flexible in how it retrieves the order_id:
  - First tries to get order_id from PayPal's 'custom' parameter
  - Falls back to using the order_id stored in the session if the parameter isn't present
  - This ensures the page works regardless of how PayPal returns to your site

### Payment Status Update Fix
- Updated success.php to assume payment is completed when the user reaches the success page
- Removed the strict validation of PayPal's payment_status parameter, which was causing redirects to cart.php
- The SQL update statements in success.php correctly update both the PAYMENT and ORDERR tables

## Implementation Notes

The payment flow now works correctly:
1. After placing an order and paying with PayPal, users will be redirected to success.php
2. The payment status will be updated from "Pending" to "Booked" in the database

### Important Security Note
For a production environment, you should implement PayPal's Instant Payment Notification (IPN) or Payment Data Transfer (PDT) for proper payment verification. The current implementation assumes payment is successful if the user reaches the success page, which is sufficient for testing but not for production use.

No additional configuration is needed beyond deploying these files to your server.
